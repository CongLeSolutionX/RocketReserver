Use following documentation make GraphQL syntax highlited:
https://github.com/apollographql/xcode-graphql
Notes:
- In Swift, if you don't annotate a property's type with either a question mark or an exclamation point, that property is non-nullable.
- In GraphQL, if you don't annotate a field's type with an exclamation point, that field is considered nullable. This is because GraphQL fields are nullable by default.
